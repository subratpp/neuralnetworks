Neural Networks codes from Scratch. The codes are written as a part of course work of "Neural Networks and Applications" at ISI Kolkata and are not very efficient. However, if someone is learning Neural Networks from scratch, the codes might help.

## 1. Perceptron:
#### Date: 10th Oct 2020
Perceptron from scratch. The model is trained on self generated dataset(linearly separable), IRIS dataset(as 2 classes are linearly separable). The python(.py) is available only for perceptron programs. Simple perceptron models are only good for linearly separable models.

*From the next project onwards only Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb) will be made available.*

## 2. Multilayer Neural Network: 
#### Date: 12th Oct 2020

The multi layer NN is developed from scratch and applied on MNIST dataset.

- Implemnted backpropagation
- Batch GD is used for training.(Mini-Batch will be implemeted in next projects)
- Hidden layers uses ReLu
- Output Layer uses Softmax
- The error function used is Cross Entropy Error
- The model achieves 97% accuracy of test data from Kaggle MNIST test data.

## 3. Upcoming Projects:
- Meta Networks from Scratch
- Minibatch GD
- Adam
